# snake_game
The provided code implements a simple Snake game using the SFML library. The game consists of a grid where a snake moves around and tries to eat food to grow longer. The objective of the game is to survive as long as possible without colliding with the boundaries of the grid or the snake's own body.

The player controls the snake's movement using the arrow keys on the keyboard. The snake can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right. The snake continuously moves in the direction set by the player, and the player must navigate it to eat the randomly placed food items that appear on the grid.

As the snake eats the food, it grows longer by adding new segments to its body. The player's score increases with each food item consumed, indicating the length of the snake. The game ends if the snake collides with the boundaries of the grid or if it collides with itself.

The game features visual elements such as grid cells representing the snake's body segments, a distinct food item, and a background image. The graphics are rendered using SFML's graphics module. Additionally, the game includes background music that plays continuously to enhance the gaming experience.

The game offers simple and addictive gameplay, challenging the player's reflexes and strategic thinking to avoid collisions and achieve a high score. It serves as an excellent example for understanding basic game mechanics, input handling, collision detection, and rendering using SFML.
